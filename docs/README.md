# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project predicts customer churn using a machine learning model built on the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**. The project structure follows the **Team Data Science Process (TDSP)**, which ensures an organized approach to solving data science problems, including analysis, modeling, app development, and containerization.

## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will stop using a service) using machine learning techniques. The prediction model is deployed in a **Streamlit** app, which allows users to interactively test model predictions.

**Dataset:**  
The **Telco Customer Churn Dataset** includes customer data with features like contract type, tenure, payment method, and whether the customer has churned or not.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn)
- **Streamlit** (for the web app)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Git** (version control)
